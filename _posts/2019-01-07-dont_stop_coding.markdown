It has been a crazy couple weeks.  I haven't had much time to devote to coding and boy do I regret it!

I am just now getting back on track and things have finally calmed down in my life.  It is insane how much you forget when you step away from the computer for too long.  I definitely have learned a valuable lesson about keeping on track.  

I am currently finishing up the last section of OO programming and am backtracking a little to refresh my memory of how it works.  It is *almost* like learning how to ride a bicycle just a bit more complex.  

I have a lot of ideas for some projects I would like to work on, most of them have to do with my passions.  I am excited to see how far I can progress.

My new goal is to never break another learning streak on here, regardless of what happens that day, I want to make sure I at least work on *something* new every day, even if it is for a very short time each night.
