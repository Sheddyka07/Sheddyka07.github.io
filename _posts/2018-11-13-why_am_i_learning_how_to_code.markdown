I am embarking on this coding journey from a pretty weird place.  

I started my adult life with a degree in "Health Information Technology" working as a coder, though it had nothing to do with computers really.  I assigned CPT and ICD-9 codes to medical bills.  I didn't really find this line of work enjoyable or challenging after awhile.  It was good to support myself and my then-boyfriend as he searched for a stable teaching job.  

After 5 years of medical coding/billing, I went back to school and got my B.S. in Education in order to become a Math/Science teacher.  I taught Science for a year, then Math for another year in a Title 1 school.  I realized that teaching at a school like that is mostly challenging because of extreme behaviors.  After daily vicious fights between students and fires in the bathroom started by 6th graders, I decided this wasn't really my thing either.

I am now working as a Training/Development Specialist, but I still don't think I've found my niche.


Why coding?  I have dabbled with it from a young age to now.  I modified HTML for my Xanga blog, made banners for my MySpace, and created a "awesome" page for my Neopets guild.  My brother was always the one who knew computers and I didn't think I would ever get to his level.

I tried some free courses online on Python out of my curiosity, and realized this was something I might actually be capable of doing.  I have always enjoyed logic puzzles and games and coding seems like a different type of logic game.  

After completing my first couple (frustrating) coding challenges, the feeling of "pride and accomplishment" is real.  I am excited to see where this takes me!
