Wow, that really didn't take long.  It seems too easy to forget the joy of coding when you step away for too long.  I just got back on track and am working through the "OO triangle" lab.  

I realized now that there are some things you really don't forget.  I also realize now just how far I have come in such a short time.  

I am really excited for my CLI project that is coming up, trying to figure out exactly what I want that project to look like for myself.  There are soo many ideas floating in my head for future projects to complete, but right now my skills are not at the point to actually put those plans into action.  Perhaps the biggest issue right now is thinking too big/complicated and not necessarily thinking about something that I can actually make right now.

I guess we will see, hopefully my next blog post will be about my project plans.
